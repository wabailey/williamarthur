An information-heavy website with Wordpress CMS for blog posting and user update support. The website incorporates design elements consistent with the NHS Digital guidelines, so that users feel comfortable and relate the site to other NHS sites. The goal of the site is to provide useful and relevant information and news to patients in the Chester area who can be served by the Chester South PCN, and provide help to that specific population.
