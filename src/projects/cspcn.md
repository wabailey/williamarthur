An information-heavy website with Wordpress CMS for blog posting and user update support. The website incorporates design elements consistent with the NHS Digital site, in order for users to feel that relation across NHS sites. The site is meant to be helpful for patients in the Chester South Primary Care Network, providing useful information to that specific population.
