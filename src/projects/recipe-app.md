A personal study on Gatsby and Contentful. Incorporating conditional rendering, graphql queries, contentful objects and APIs and dynamic page creation to create a content-heavy recipes website with a searchable database and search filters. This study was helpful in understanding how to incorporate a headless CMS into a Gatsby project, communicating with APIs, and also querying GraphQL to access site content.
