A personal study on Gatsby and Contentful. Incorporating conditional rendering, graphql queries, contentful content models, and dynamic page creation to create a content-heavy, recipe-based website, with a searchable database and search filters. This study was helpful in understanding how to incorporate a headless CMS into a Gatsby project, and communicating with APIs and graphql queries in order to access database content.
